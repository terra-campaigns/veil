**Morro Novo** - "New Hill" - is a Kult adventure that takes place in a failed gentrified Favela in Rio de Janeiro. It is based on the Kult scenario "The Summit".

1. **Digital Conspiracy**: Brought together by your shared obsession on an internet forum dedicated to the occult, you are drawn into a civilian investigation of Morro Novo—a place shrouded in conspiracy theories of strange disappearances, hauntings, and occult activity. What draws you there?
2. **The Heat**: Nestled in a favela, Morro Novo is an abandoned luxury project now warped by decay and heat. The oppressive, unrelenting warmth seems to pulse through the complex, creating a surreal, almost feverish atmosphere that heightens every sensation and desire, drawing people back again and again. How does the heat excites you?
3. **Again and again**: You are far from the first drawn here. Groups have ventured in before, each pulled by rumours of dark secrets or forbidden pleasures—and some are rumoured to still be inside, unable to escape its grip. Is this really the first time you are coming to Morro Novo?
