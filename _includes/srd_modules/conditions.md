# Deprivation & Fatigue

- A PC that lacks a crucial need (such as food or rest) is **Deprived**. A **Deprived** PC cannot recover HP, Attributes. Anyone **Deprived** for more than a day gains **Fatigue**.
- A PC may gain **Fatigue** after using special powers or due to events occurring in the fiction. **Fatigue** lasts until the PC is able to recuperate (such as with a full nightâ€™s rest in a safe spot).
- A PC cannot use powers that add **Fatigue**, if they already have **Fatigue**.
