## Reactions
{: .no_toc }

When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

|         |      |         |      |         |
| :-----: | :--: | :-----: | :--: | :-----: |
|    2    | 3-5  |   6-8   | 9-11 |   12    |
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Kind | Helpful |

## Morale
{: .no_toc }

- Enemies must pass a WIL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. 
- Some groups may use their leader's WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 HP. 
- Morale does not affect PCs.

## Hirelings
{: .no_toc }

- Adventuring parties can recruit hirelings, relying on their unique skills, knowledge, and training to aid in expeditions.  
- To create a hireling, choose an appropriate role from the [Hirelings](/wip/2e/marketplace#hirelings-per-day) table in the Marketplace. Roll 3d6 for each attribute and 1d6 for their HP. Give them **equipment** appropriate to their station, then roll on the Character Traits tables to further flesh them out.
- Alternatively, choose an appropriate [**background**](/wip/2e/character-creation#backgrounds) and **name** from the [Character Creation](/wip/2e/character-creation) guide. Roll (or choose from) the tables for that background. Then roll for Rations, Gold Pieces, Attributes, HP, and age.
