# Hit Protection

- Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting **Hit Protection (HP)**, which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. It does not indicate a characterâ€™s health or fortitude, nor do they lose it for very long. See [Healing & Recovery](core-rules.md#Healing%20&%20Recovery). 
- If an attack would take a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the [Scars](core-rules.md#Scars) table.
- If you are unaware of harm, you are **Exposed**, and your **HP** is set to **0** until you become aware.
