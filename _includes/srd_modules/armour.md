# Armour

- Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's **Armour** value from the result of damage rolls. 
- Shields and similar armour provide a bonus defence (e.g. +1 Armour), but only while the item is held or worn. Some may also provide additional benefits, depending on the fiction.
- A PC, NPC, or monster cannot have more than 3 Armour.
