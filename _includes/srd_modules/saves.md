# Saves

A save is a roll to avoid negative outcomes from risky choices.
Characters roll a d20 and compare the results to the appropriate attribute.
If they roll equal to or under that attribute, they succeed.
Otherwise, they fail.

Many risks that call for a save bypass HP altogether.
Communicate the risk clearly to your players if they have a chance to decide on a different course of action.

If two opponents are each trying to overcome the other, both parties roll and the highest successful save wins.
If two characters need to take an action together, whoever is most at risk should save (usually the character with the lowest relevant **Attribute**).

## Task Resolution

When a player attempts to do something such as pick a lock, drive a speeder, or hack a computer, three task resolution factors should be taken into consideration: training, tools, and time. 

- **If a player has all three:** training (inferred from background, a skill, etc.), appropriate tools (an item), and enough time (usually 10 mins), they will alway succeed. 
- **If a player is missing one of the above**, a Save might be appropriate, with a failed save resulting in a consequence, such as getting caught, breaking the tool, or not being able to solve the problem. 
- **If a player is missing two of the above**, it is usually impossible to resolve the task at hand, or the results of failing a Save could potentially be very dangerous.

## Advantage & Disadvantage

When a character has some sort of leverage or is at some sort of handicap, and a save is required, give them enhanced success or reduced failure for **Advantage** and mixed success or disastrous failure for **Disadvantage**.
